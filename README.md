# Software Engineering Final
## Overview 
Using Azure DevOps and Python, my team and I developed a website to showcase breweries all throughout the United States from pulling a public REST API. Through this website, we encorporated a map with pin-points to each brewery, as well as a review page where customers can leave reviews. Through Azure DevOps, we used sentiment analysis to automatically categorize each review into postiive, negative, or neutral and keep a running score of the category each brewery falls under. 

## Python Script
Flask is a required dependency, used to link our Python script with Azure DevOps. Through Python, we developed our file, app.py, where we scritped how our app would run, including the Azure DevOps sentiment analysis.
